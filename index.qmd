Troy Kaufman is a senior general engineering major at Harvey Mudd College. He has a deep interest in digital design especially in embedded systems. He has worked as a digital design intern at The Aerospace Corporation for the past two summers and learned an incredible amount of information on space hardware designs ranging from safe HDL practices to integrating satellite subsystems and facillitating communication between SoCs. Troy enjoys to play disc golf with his family, watch professional wrestling, and engulfs himself in Star Wars lore (especially in the Clone Wars era!).
