As an intern with The Aerospace Corporation this past summer, he worked on facilitating communication between an FPGA and SPI NOR flash memory. Troy also created an FPGA subsystem that monitored and replied to a proprietary satellite interface. His hobbies include playing disc golf, scripted wrestling, and building weird devices with friends."

Despite the premise being to turn on LEDs in various fashions, the lab was gruelling in some aspects. This lab was a neat introduction to the digital design world."
