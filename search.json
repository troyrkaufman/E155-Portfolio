    "text": "Summary\nLab 1 introduced students to the digital design world by giving them experience with the FPGA design flow from creating block diagrams to synthesizing hardware on an FPGA. The main goals of this lab was to produce a 2.4 Hz blinking LED along with driving other LEDs based on XOR and AND logic. Additionally, a seven segment display would illustrate the current hexadecimal number input from the DIP switches located on the development board.\nSeveral SystemVerilog modules produced the necessary logic to perform the requirements, and circuit analysis was used to calculate components to drive the seven segment display according to the Specs sheet.\nOverall, this lab took 9 hours to finish which included soldering the development board together and fixing ST-link/J-link issues along with the hardware design and debugging.\n\n\nDesign\nThe first aspect to consider in the project was separating the design approaches for the two main goals: blinking an LED and driving a seven segment display. A top module would instantiate these two designs along with providing the high speed oscillator developed by Lattice Radiant as seen in the BLOCK DIAGRAM BELOW.\n\n![Block Diagram][e155_lab1_block_diagram.jpg] Figure 1: System Block Diagram\n\nThe seven segment display could be handled by strictly utilizing combinational logic via a case statement to manipulate the seven bit signals. As for the blinking LED, a counter was used to delay driving LED. The calculation is the following: ADD\n\n\nVerification"

Despite the premise being to turn on LEDs in various fashions, the lab was gruelling in some aspects. This lab was a neat introduction to the digital design world."
