## Summary
I soldered surface mount and through hole components on the MicroPs development board. To test the board, I flashed simple programs on the FPGA and MCU to establish viewable communication between the two. 

## Reflections
Soldering surface mounted parts provided me with a new challenge that was quite exciting and frustrating simultaneously. I enjoyed Radiant's intuitive FPGA design flow process compared to other IDE synthesizers like Xilinx Vivado.
